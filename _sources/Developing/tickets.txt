Working on Tickets
==================

Most software engineering organizations manage work using some form of Tickets.
These can be JIRA issues, GitHub Issues, Redmine tickets, etc. Handling these
tickets effectively is crucial to being a successful software engineer.


Questions to ask when you've been assigned a ticket
---------------------------------------------------

* [ ] Do I understand why this should be done?
* [ ] Do I understand how this should be done?
* [ ] What are the key challenges in this project?
* [ ] How long do I have to complete this?
* [ ] Who can I ask if I have technical questions?
* [ ] Who do I ask if I have functionality questions?


Deliverables
------------

When you've finished a ticket, you should be delivering all of these components.
Some teams may choose to omit some most of these items. If your team does, fork
this project and edit this file!

* [ ] Technical specification
* [ ] Code
* [ ] Tests
* [ ] Technical documentation (how it works)
* [ ] User documentation (how to use it)
