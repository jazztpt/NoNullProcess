Why Startups Should have an Onboarding Process
==============================================

Tech Startup companies are intrinsically focused on innovation. In order to
innovate rapidly,  startups need to identify which company functions should be
captured as written processes so creative energy can be focused on creating
products that will drive your success. Every time a new employee is needed, 
it costs the organization hiring dividends. Between recruiting, interviewing, 
training, productivity losses, etc; it costs approximately 30% to 50% of that 
employeeâ€™s annual salary to replace them.  Some of the hidden costs of turnover 
include lower productivity, training, lost knowlege, and overworked remaining 
staff. Not to mention, potential for loss of customers or loss of productivity 
on team-based projects, due to understaffing or poor customer service during a 
time of turnover. These costs can easily go well beyond the 50% of annual salary 
calculation if they are high-level or highly specialized employees. Here's an

Investing in bringing new employees up to speed is a smart way to  get the most 
out your recruiting and hiring efforts. Onboarding is a process that every 
startup should create once and then implement consistently. Onboarding ensures 
that new hires get adjusted to the social and performance aspects of their jobs 
quickly and smoothly, and learn the attitudes, knowledge, skills, and behaviors 
required to function effectively within the company. The lack of process for 
Onboarding means that every new hire has a different experience and the probability 
of losing that employee within the first 90 days increases dramatically.

Best Practices for Onboarding

* Implement the basics prior to the first day on the job.
* Make the first day on the job special.
* Use formal orientation programs.
* Ask new employee for input on the onboarding plan.
* Develop a written onboarding plan.
* Be sure your program is consistently implemented.
* Ensure that the program is monitored over time.
* Use technology to facilitate the process.
* Use milestones, such as 30, 60, 90 and 120 days on the job 
to check in on employee progress.
* Engage stakeholders in planning.
* Include key stakeholder meetings as part of the program.
* Be crystal clear with new employees in terms of:
 + Objectives
 + Timelines
 + Roles
 + Responsibilities
