Why Should Startups have an Onboarding Process
==============================================

Tech Startup companies are intrinsically focused on innovation. In order to
innovate rapidly,  startups needs to identify which company functions should be
captured as written processes so creative energy can be focused on creating
products that will drive your success. A good example of a process that every
startup should create once and then implement consistently is Onboarding.

Onboarding is the process by which new hires get adjusted to the social and
performance aspects of their jobs quickly and smoothly, and learn the attitudes,
knowledge, skills, and behaviors required to function effectively within an
organization.The lack of process for Onboarding means that every new hire has a
different experience and the probability of losing that employee within the
first 90 days increases.

Best Practices for Onboarding

* Implement the basics prior to the first day on the job.
* Make the first day on the job special.
* Use formal orientation programs.
* Develop a written onboarding plan.
* Make onboarding participatory.
* Be sure your program is consistently implemented.
* Ensure that the program is monitored over time.
* Use technology to facilitate the process.
* Use milestones, such as 30, 60, 90 and 120 days on the job—and up to one year
  post-organizational entry—to check in on employee progress.
* Engage stakeholders in planning.
* Include key stakeholder meetings as part of the program.
* Be crystal clear with new employees in terms of:
 * Objectives.
 * Timelines.
 * Roles.
 * Responsibilities
